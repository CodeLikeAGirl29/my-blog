                <h2>
                    Naming Conventions
                    <h2>
                        <p>We will provide you with the key to decoding BMW car names using the example of the BMW 745e. “The first number of the three-digit combination of a BMW stands for the segment or model series,” says expert Petra Marz. The numbers
                            always indicate at what end of the size spectrum the car is located: the larger the number, the larger the car. Even numbers are generally given to the ultra-sporty versions such as coupes. In communications, designations such
                            as sedan or convertible are also added to the vehicle name to make it easier for customers.
                        </p>
                        <p>The two digits that come next, i.e. the 45 in the 745e, used to indicate the displacement of the engine (e.g. 30 for a 3.0-liter engine displacement). Today, they indicate the engine’s performance in kilowatts (kW), or its “virtual
                            displacement.” A vehicle with the number 45 has a performance of between 300 and 350 kW. With the universal launch of turbo, hybrid and electric engines, BMW has continued the stringent application of its naming convention.
                        </p>
                        <p>The last part of the model name includes a lowercase letter that stands for the drive technology. Gasoline-powered cars (injection vehicles) bear an i, and diesel engines have a d. An e in the model name means that it is a plug-in
                            hybrid, as is the case with our BMW 745e PHEV. All-wheel drive vehicles have xDrive attached to their name. sDrive stands for front-wheel or rear-wheel drive, but is only referred to in the X and Z models.</p>

                        <br>
                        <h2>Electric Car</h2>
                        <p>Introduced only a year before the oil crisis of 1973, the 1602e was an early attempt from BMW to make an electric car. Two of them were on parade at the 1972 Olympic Games in Munich looking virtually the same as the standard 1602,
                            but hiding one major change underneath the hood. Gone was the combustion engine and instead the engineers installed a pallet of a dozen standard 12V lead-acid batteries developed by Varta. Thus, the first electric BMW was born.</p>
                        <br>
                        <h2>World Record Drifting</h2>
                        <p>A BMW M5 has obliterated the world record for the greatest distance vehicle drift with a ridiculous eight hour, 232.5-mile (374.2 km) sideways jaunt at the Performance Center skid pad in South Carolina. Just to add a little more
                            spice, the car was refueled jet fighter-style while in motion and the record for the longest twin vehicle drift was set on the same day.</p>
